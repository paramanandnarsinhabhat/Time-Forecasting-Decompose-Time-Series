# Time Series Decomposition Project

This repository demonstrates time series decomposition using Python's `statsmodels` library.

## Overview

Time series decomposition involves breaking down a time series dataset into trend, seasonality, and noise components. This project applies decomposition to the `train_data.csv` dataset to analyze its underlying patterns.

## Requirements

- `pandas`: For reading data and handling dates.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the time series and its components.
- `statsmodels`: For using the `seasonal_decompose` method.

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Load the `train_data.csv`, preprocess dates, and plot the original time series. Perform seasonal decomposition to extract the trend, seasonality, and residuals, and then visualize the components.

## Visualization

The notebook and scripts will generate plots of the original time series as well as its decomposed components.

## Contributions

Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome.
